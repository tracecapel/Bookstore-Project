This is a project I did in my freshman Intro to Comp Sci 2 class. It is a model of an interactive online bookstore. The functions of this program include:

Registering user as a new member
Logging in as an existing customer
Activating/deactivating premium membership
Completing a purchase
Tracking stock of items
Admin access to view stock of items, and view how much each customer has spent
Updating payment method
